Hey there, Hi, Hello.

I am a Full-Stack Developer (predominately Front-End), with expertise in React, Typescript, JavaScript ES6, and Next.js. I have a working knowledge of Node.js and other Back-End technologies. I began my coding journey in early 2019 and since then I've dedicated myself to trying to build fun and interesting Websites and WebApps.

This Repo contains my side projects going back to the beginner days. Don't look too closely at that early code, I only leave it here to remember how far I've come.

Cheers,
Stevie
