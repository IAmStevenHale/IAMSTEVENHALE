Welcome to my GitHub repository!

I'm a Full-stack software developer, I started out back in 2019. I'm proficient in a variety of technologies including React, Typescript, CSS3/SCSS/LESS, Git, JavaScript ES6, Node.js, and Next.js.

I'm a pro at both front-end and back-end development and I'm comfortable working on both sides of the stack. My experience with React, Typescript, and Next.js has given me the ability to build high-performance, scalable web applications that provide a seamless user experience. Plus, I'm also skilled in CSS3/SCSS/LESS and Styled-Components which helps me create visually appealing designs that adapt to different screens and devices.

I'm a big fan of Git and I use it to collaborate with other developers on projects. I am also familiar with JavaScript ES6 and Node.js, which allows me to write server-side code and build APIs that can be easily consumed by front-end applications.

I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies. I'm a proactive and detail-oriented developer who enjoys working on challenging projects and collaborating with a team. And let's not forget, I'm a huge pizza connoisseur.

Take a look around my repository, and if you like what you see, give me a follow!

Cheers,

Stevie.
